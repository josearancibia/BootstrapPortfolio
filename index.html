<h2>About Me</h2>

<p class="main-content">Born on September 22, 1989 to a family of five - I have spent my years throughout various parts of New Jersey with my two sisters and parents. I spent the first few years of my life in Harrison, NJ until my 9th birthday when my family moved to Sayreville. A year later we moved again and settled down in Belleville. It was not until my 22nd birthday that I moved to Bayonne, where I currently live with my partner of seven years, William (pictured above). Now with three nephews, a niece and my sister's respective partners, our family has grown quite a bit!</p>

<p>My hobbies vary far and wide. From painting to performance arts - you can be certain I've tried it all! My appreciation for technology and video games has led me to where I am today. I hope to achieve better web development skills by the end of this class. I want to leave this boot camp with an indispensible set of skills that will push me forward in the workforce. Coding started off as a hobby, but with the experience gained in this class I am determined to make it a profession. What I want to do come November is be able to use the skills I've learned to catapult myself into the workforce where I can hone my skills and become an integral asset to a web-development team. I want to find myself in a position where I can use my passion for art, video games, and technology. If I can pursue a career path that allows all these passions to intersect, that would be tremendous!</p>

<p>Presently, I am devoted to completing this course and round myself out as a web developer. When this class is over, I will continue to use the skills you have provided me and expand my knowledge to the best of my ability.<mark>A programmer is only as good as what he can learn - now more than ever <strong>I'm ready to crush this bootcamp!</strong></mark></p>

		<p><small>While coding is currently taking up all my time and focus, in my spare time I can be found playing board games, video games, or watching some sort of animated film. As a big fan of the arts, animation, coding and gaming - I hope to bring all of these interests together through web-development. 
		<br>
		<br>
		I'm readily available for employment and am eager to use my passion to rise up to the challenge!</small></p>
